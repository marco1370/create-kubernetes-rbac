## Create Kubernetes Service / User Account restricted to one Namespace 

## How can I create a user and restrict user to access only one namespace in Kubernetes?. Kubernetes gives you a way to regulate access to Kubernetes clusters and resources based on the roles of individual users through a feature called Role-based access control (RBAC)
**

  ```
Role: A role contains rules that represent a set of permissions. A role is used to grant access to resources within a namespace.
RoleBinding: A role binding is used to grant the permissions defined in a role to a user or set of users. It holds a list of subjects (users, groups, or service accounts), and a reference to the role being granted
Service Account: Account meant for for processes, which run in pods
```


To achieve a complete isolation in Kubernetes, weâ€™ll use the concepts on namespaces and role based access control. The idea behind service accounts is based on the principle of least privilege. An account is created for specific tasks.

 
## Create and Limit Service account to a namespace in Kubernetes

```
Step 1: Create a namespace
Step 2: Create a Service Account
Step 3: Create a Role
Step 4: Bind the role to a user
Step 5: Creating kubectl configuration

```


## Request a token to authenticate to the kube-apiserver as the service account "myapp-demozarin-v4" in the current namespace

```
kubectl create token zarinpal-v4-demo-user    --duration 100000  -n zarinpal-v4-demo



  # Request a token with a custom expiration


  kubectl create token myazarinpal-v4-demo-user  --duration 10m
```
